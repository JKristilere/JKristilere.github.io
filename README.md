# Predicting heart disease using machine learning

This project looks into using various machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model which is capable of predicting whether a medical patient has heart disease or not based on their medical attributes.

Approach/methodology:
1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation


## 1. Problem Definition

Given medical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether a patient has heart disease or not?


## 2. Data

Data used during this project was obatained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease

It can also be obtained from kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data

## 3. Evaluation
> If we can reach 95% accuracy of whether a patient has heart disease or not during proof of concept, we'll pursue the project further.

## 4. Features
**Data dictionary**

* age (Age of the patient in years)
* sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
* cp chest pain type ([typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal, asymptomatic])
* trestbps resting blood pressure (resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital))
* chol (serum cholesterol in mg/dl)
* fbs (if fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)
* restecg (resting electrocardiographic results)
* thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
* exang: exercise-induced angina (True/ False)
* oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
* thal: [normal; fixed defect; reversible defect]
* num: the predicted attribute
